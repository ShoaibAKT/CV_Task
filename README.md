Computer Vision - Synthetic Datasets, Visualizations, Images augmentations

Task1: Create Synthetic dataset of signatures on Pakistani Identity Cards

Task2: Annotate 6 to 7 images (you can use attached cat_dog.zip for this and annotate cats and dogs using rectangles) using via annotator (find on internet or use the provided one in attachments), save the project, it will save all the annotations to a json file. Now your task is to create a notebook which load data from that json, load the information of bounding boxes along with label names and display / draw those on their respective images.

Task3: Augment the images provided in cat_dog.zip for

i) rotation: create 72 images agains each single image for each 5 degree i.e., for 1.jpeg there should be 1_5degree.jpeg, 1_10degree.jpeg, 1_15degree.jpeg, ..., 1_350degree.jpeg and 1_355degree.jpeg (total 72 images) and 72 images for all other images too. There are 7 images in cat_dog.zip so the resultant folder should contain total 504 images

ii) brightness: change brightness to random level and create 5 images for each single image. Resultant directory should contain 7*5=35 images

iii) noise: add noise to create 5 images for each single image. Resultant directory should contain 7*5=35 images
